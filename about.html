<p>Hello! <br>
<strong>My name is Sean Narkewich and I am a Freshman at URI. I am 18 years old and I have been <br> 
living in Medfield, Mass for the last 7 years. I did theatre, chorus and band in high school, <br>
and I hope to continue doing those things in the future. I like to bake, I am a big fan of <br> 
making cookies ans cakes; I also performed in my high schools acapella group Soundwaves. <br> <img id="me" src="me.jpg" height="150" width="195" align="right"
I hope to meet new people at my time at URI and I can't wait for all the adventures I will <br>
be able to partake in.</strong> </p><img id="theatre" src="theatre.jpg" width="195" height="150">
